# Trash-E

I have a trash idea: let's make a robot that can pick up trash.

It is sad to see trash littered throughout our beautiful earth. Either on the side of the road, in a park, or out in the wild, trash has a tendency to be noticed, yet hopelessly ignored. However, no one really wants to go around picking up trash all day, so I think we should make a robot that can do it for us.

## The Idea

Let's make an open-source project that enables anyone to build a simple robot that can pick up trash. The robot will be able to pick up trash and dispose of it in a way that's cheap, efficient, and environmentally friendly.

## Execution

This should be an open-source project for several reasons:
    
1. It will speed up the development process, enabling people from around the world to contribute to the engineering design.

2. The more people that are involved, the more trash robots there will be, and the less trash there will be.

3. It will make it cheaper to both design and build the robot.

4. The idea is not unique - there's a whole Disney movie made from this concept. However, it is most certainly worth pursuing. Also it's not like Disney is going to make a trash robot anytime soon.

5. Anyone could take the platform of the robot and do something different with it, which could be more profitable, and probably worth their time and effort, which would probably benefit the project as a whole.


The robot should be simple and cheap. 80% of the components should be able to be 3D printed, and the remaining 20% easy to find online. 

## The Robot

The robot will be a simple, four wheeled robot that can pick up trash and dispose of it. It will be able to navigate simple terrain, such as pavement, grass, dirt, and gravel.

The robot will have four wheels, a body, battery, and a trash bin. The trash bin will be able to be opened and closed, and will be able to be emptied. The robot will have a camera that will be able to detect trash, and a mechanism that will be able to pick up the trash.
